# dotfiles

My personal bash environment, slowly accreting functionality.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:garrow/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles

    # For just shell scripts & config
    ./first_install.sh

    # For apps
    ./first_install.sh install
## Features

Git completion, lots of short aliases, dynamic rvm loading, pretty colours.
